# Symfony5: The Fast Track
The project is best described by Fabien.

>The book describes the creation of an application, from scratch to production. We won’t develop everything to make it production ready though. The result won’t be perfect. We will take shortcuts. We might even skip some edge-case handling, validation or tests. Best practices won’t be respected all the time. But we are going to touch on almost every aspect of a modern Symfony project.
